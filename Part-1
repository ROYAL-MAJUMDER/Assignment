PART-1 



üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD)



1. Product Overview



The product is a Container Image Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard that helps users:



Scan thousands of container images in their repositories.



Identify vulnerabilities present in each image.



Prioritize based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).



Provide guidance on remediation/fix.





Target audience: DevOps, Security, and Cloud teams managing containerized applications.





---



2. Goals & Objectives



Visibility: Provide an overview of vulnerabilities across all container images.



Prioritization: Highlight images with critical/high vulnerabilities for immediate action.



Scalability: Handle thousands of container images efficiently.



Actionability: Enable filtering, searching, sorting, and drill-down into specific image details.

3. Key Features



3.1 Dashboard



Overview of scanned images.



Summary widgets:



Total images scanned.



Number of vulnerable images.



Distribution by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).



Trend over time (optional future feature).







3.2 Image List View



Table of all container images.



Columns:



Image name & tag.



Registry/repository.



Last scan date.



Number of vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).



Status (Safe / Needs Attention).





User actions:



Sort by severity, name, last scanned.



Search images.



Filter (e.g., ‚ÄúShow only Critical‚Äù).







3.3 Image Detail View



Detailed breakdown for a selected image:



Image metadata (name, tag, size, creation date).



Vulnerability list (CVE ID, severity, package affected, fixed version if available).



Suggested fixes (update to patched version).







3.4 Bulk Actions



Select multiple images for:



Exporting vulnerability reports.



Marking as ‚ÄúAcknowledged.‚Äù



Scheduling rescans.

4. User Stories



1. As a security engineer, I want to see which images have vulnerabilities, so I can prioritize remediation.





2. As a DevOps engineer, I want to filter images by severity, so I can focus on critical risks first.





3. As a team lead, I want an at-a-glance dashboard, so I can report security posture to stakeholders.





4. As a developer, I want to see fix suggestions (patched versions), so I can update my Dockerfiles quickly.









---



5. Success Metrics



Time to identify critical vulnerabilities reduced.



% of critical vulnerabilities fixed within SLA.



User adoption (frequency of dashboard usage).







---



6. Constraints & Assumptions



Scans may take time ‚Üí async scans with progress indicators.



Must integrate with common registries (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, etc.).



API-first design ‚Üí enable CI/CD pipeline integration.
